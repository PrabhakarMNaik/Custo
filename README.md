# Custo

Custo is your personal Custodian of time. You can keep the track of how you utilized your screen time today. Once started, you can take a look at how you have done till now by just moving your mouse pointer to the lower right corner of the screen. When you stop the recording Custo will save your performance in a CSV file that you can view later on just to reminisce about how you used to be (and how Custo changed your life for better).

The idea behind screen time monitoring is based on the [TED talk](https://youtu.be/xp0O2vi8DX4) by Tali Sharot on How to Motivate Yourself. This time tracking will positively reinforce you when you are being productive and let you know when you are not.  Custo should cover you for immediate reward and progress monitoring.

By default the logs would be saved in the folder where your script lives. Feel Free to change the `FOLDER_PATH` to change it to your desired location. Might add a field to accept this path as a user input in the GUI itself in the future.  

## Usage

If you are not a programmer and don’t have a native python installation, fear not, there is an exe version for you. I haven’t encrypted it (just to be more transparent) so your virus scanner may give you some trouble. 

Been using this technique for couple of weeks and personally I feel great. 

Let me know your thoughts.
